# FalAI raw dataset repository

This is a repository where it is possible to access the raw data of the FalAI dataset.

Inside the **metadadata folder** you will find:

- csv with the text dataset.
- csv with the dataset of senteces exported from the database (similar to the previous one).
- csv with the files dataset exported from the database (divided into three parts due to its size).
- csv with the user dataset exported from the database.

The FalAI dataset is currently under revision and validation and in the coming months we will upload a second version with the validated audios and the corresponding metadata.

If you would like to access the raw data of the audios, please send an email to **falai@balidea.com** with the subject **raw data**, indicating which **organisation** you belong to and what you want to **use the data for**, and we will contact you to provide the download link.

For questions, problems or suggestions, please also send an email to **falai@balidea.com**.

All the data has been exported on **15 May 2023**.
