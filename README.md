# FalAI raw dataset repository

This is a repository where it is possible to access the raw data of the FalAI dataset.
FalAI is a dataset for end-to-end spoken language understanding in Galician (conversational assistants). FalAI is composed of more than 250,000 speech recordings (more than 250 hours) over a corpus of 3,500 sentences, in 14 domains, with more than 60 different intents and more than 60 types of slots. More than 11,000 people from all age ranges and all areas of Galicia have participated in the creation of falAI.

Inside the **metadadata folder** you will find:

- csv with the text dataset.
- csv with the dataset of senteces exported from the database (similar to the previous one).
- csv with the files dataset exported from the database (divided into three parts due to its size).
- csv with the user dataset exported from the database.

The FalAI dataset is currently under revision and validation and in the coming months we will upload a second version with the validated audios and the corresponding metadata.

If you would like to access the raw data of the audios, please send an email to **falai@balidea.com** with the subject **raw data**, indicating which **organisation** you belong to and what you want to **use the data for**, and we will contact you to provide the download link.

For questions, problems or suggestions, please also send an email to **falai@balidea.com**.

All the data has been exported on **16 May 2023**.
